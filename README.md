## Web Visualization Dashboard
I have created a [dashboard](https://joannepeel.github.io/) using HTML and CSS to show the results of my [Weather_API_Analysis](https://github.com/JoannePeel/Weather_API_Analysis).

The website consists of 7 seperate webpages:
1. The landing page containing:
* An explanation of the project.
* Links to each visualizations page.

2. Four visualization pages, each with:
* A descriptive title and heading tag.
* The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
* A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3. A "Comparisons" page that:
* Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
* Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

4. A "Data" page that:
* Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
